# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
This programming language is used to create images, or more specifically, create complex images using only variations of
	circles, triangles, and squares. Combining with the ability to render images with size up to 100 mega pixels, I believe 
	the program is directed towards people who liked to design but just not o nthe professional level yet. 

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
Like said above, this program has the ability to manipulate a large amount of shapes, allowing people to create images 
	only defined by their coding ability and tehir imagination. Also, as a DSL, Context Free excels in handling programs 
	written to create images only and also by using precise "expressions" that is specific to this area. 

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
Due to the properties of Context Free and DSLs, their scope of use is relatively narrow, many are designed specificlly to
	complete directions specific for one category. This meant that it is hard for Context Free to complete things outsisw of 
	its scope. One challenge when using Context Free is that the program shapes is limited to circles, squares, and triangles,
	which meant that it is hard for one to draw something like a detailed car, or other things with irregular shapes. In short,
	the program excels in completing the tasks it is designed for, but not for completing other actions.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
I learned how to program in this language by using the github wiki on Context Free to learn about the language, uses of each
	codem and also the appropriate time to use it. I also took ideas and also concepts from the example program to strengthen my
	understanding.

## Describe what happens when a ContextFree program runs
_Specifically, how does the computer interpret the rules in a program, in
order to turn those rules into a picture?_
When a Context Free program runs, the program is similar to a tree. The program takes the basic shapes of cirle, square, and 
	triangle to create complex shapes. The complex shapes are difined and created by the "rules." Each rule is basically how to 
	"build" each shape. By expnding the most complex shapes into shaoes smaller and smaller and eventually into the basic shapes
	the program is able to create complex images with simple ideas and little code. 


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
I believe the most interesting thing about the program I wrote is the layout and the ordered structure of the image. Before, 
	I can't imagine creating relatively complex image like that with only short, simple lines of code. What's more, the loop 
	structure is very interesting as it is very different fro mthat of a java loop, probably due to how this is solely for 
	creating images. In conclusion, I think this program is a great building block for me understanding DSLs.
