#  How much time did you spend on this assignment?
I am not very sure as to how much time I spend on this assignment but I think I spent approximately 8.5-9 hours:
1) 2.5 hours to read the Assignment Workflow, understand how to use and setup GitHub locally, and upload my CodingBat program to GitHub
2) 1.5-2 hours to go through and learn how to use ContextFree while experimenting with some simple programs
3) 1.5 hours to experiment with some programs in ContextFree and finalising my submission
4) 1.5 hours in reading Fowler Chapter 2
5) 1.25 hours to think about and answer all the discussion questions
# Discussion questions / topics
Below, add one or two things that you might want to discuss when we meet again.
Examples include: "I didn't understand X, could we talk about it some more?", or
"I disagree with readings in the following way:", or "I discovered something
cool: ".

I didn't entirely understand the classifications of DSLs into external and internal - could we please discuss that some more? Thank you!
