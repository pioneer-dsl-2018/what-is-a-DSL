#  How much time did you spend on this assignment?

About 6-7 hours.

I spend 2 hours reading the book and doing some little research in helping me know more about the DSL language.
I spend about 3 hours on learning and doing my Context Free graph as well as answering the questions.
I spend about 1 hours on reviewing my classmate's work.

# Discussion questions / topics
Below, add one or two things that you might want to discuss when we meet again.
Examples include: "I didn't understand X, could we talk about it some more?", or
"I disagree with readings in the following way:", or "I discovered something
cool: ".

I cannot really determine whether Context Free is an internal or External since I cannot determine if it has its own grammar or it is similar to C/Java/Python.
